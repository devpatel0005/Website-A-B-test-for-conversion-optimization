# E-Commerce A/B Testing for Conversion Optimization

**Author:** Dev Dharmesh Patel  
**Project Type:** Statistical Analysis & Data Science  
**Domain:** E-commerce Analytics & Conversion Rate Optimization

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive A/B testing framework for optimizing e-commerce checkout funnel conversion rates. The analysis employs rigorous statistical methods to determine whether a new checkout design significantly outperforms the existing one, providing data-driven insights for business decision-making.

### 🎯 Business Problem

An e-commerce startup developed a new checkout funnel (Variant B) and needs statistical evidence to determine if it significantly outperforms their current checkout process (Variant A). The goal is to make an informed, data-driven decision about implementing the new design platform-wide.

### 📈 Key Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Determine statistical significance of conversion rate differences
- **Business Impact:** Quantify potential revenue improvement from design changes
- **Decision Support:** Provide clear recommendations for implementation
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate confidence levels and potential outcomes

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

### Programming Languages
- **Python 3.x** - Primary analysis language

### Libraries & Frameworks
- **Data Analysis:** NumPy, Pandas
- **Statistical Testing:** SciPy, Statsmodels
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Two-proportion Z-test

### Statistical Methods
- Confidence Interval Analysis
- Two-Proportion Z-Test
- Sequential Testing (Real-time monitoring)
- Binomial Distribution Modeling

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Experimental Design
- **Sample Size:** 10,000 visitors per variant
- **Control Group (A):** Existing checkout funnel
- **Treatment Group (B):** New optimized checkout funnel
- **Primary Metric:** Conversion Rate (Purchases / Visitors)
- **Confidence Level:** 95%

### 2. Statistical Framework
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** p_B ≤ p_A (New funnel ≤ Old funnel)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** p_B > p_A (New funnel > Old funnel)
- **Significance Level:** α = 0.05
- **Test Type:** One-tailed two-proportion Z-test

### 3. Analysis Components
1. **Data Simulation:** Realistic conversion pattern modeling
2. **Confidence Intervals:** 95% CI calculation for both variants
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistical significance evaluation
4. **Visualization:** Professional charts and dashboards
5. **Real-time Monitoring:** Sequential testing implementation

## 📊 Key Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Baseline Conversion Rate (A):** ~9.73%
- **Treatment Conversion Rate (B):** ~11.34%
- **Absolute Lift:** +1.61 percentage points
- **Relative Improvement:** +16.5%

### Statistical Significance
- **Z-statistic:** 3.708
- **P-value:** < 0.001
- **Result:** Statistically significant improvement
- **Confidence Intervals:** Non-overlapping (supporting significance)

### Business Impact
- **Revenue Uplift:** 16.5% increase in conversion rate
- **Risk Assessment:** 95% confidence in positive results
- **Implementation Recommendation:** Adopt Variant B

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

### 1. Confidence Interval Analysis
- **Variant A CI:** [9.15%, 10.31%]
- **Variant B CI:** [10.72%, 11.96%]
- **Interpretation:** Non-overlapping intervals indicate real performance difference

### 2. Hypothesis Testing
- **Statistical Method:** Two-proportion Z-test
- **Decision:** Reject null hypothesis (p < 0.05)
- **Conclusion:** Variant B significantly outperforms Variant A

### 3. Real-time Monitoring
- **Sequential Testing:** Batch-by-batch analysis
- **Early Detection:** Significance detected at 6,000 visitors per variant
- **Monitoring Capability:** Real-time decision support system
